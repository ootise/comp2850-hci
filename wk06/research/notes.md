## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."
